## implementation history

major milestones in the life cycle of a kep should be tracked in `implementation history`.
major milestones might include

- the `summary` and `motivation` sections being merged signaling sig acceptance
- the `proposal` section being merged signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first kubernetes release where an initial version of the kep was available
- the version of kubernetes where the kep graduated to general availability
- when the kep was retired or superseded
