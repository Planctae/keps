The `Summary` section is incredibly important for producing high quality user focused documentation such as release notes or a development road map.
It should be possible to collect this information before implementation begins in order to avoid requiring implementors to split their attention between writing release notes and implementing the feature itself.
KEP editors, SIG Docs, and SIG PM should help to ensure that the tone and content of the `Summary` section is useful for a wide audience.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.
