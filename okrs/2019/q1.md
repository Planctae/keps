## Introduction

We have been blessed, or cursed, with amazing organic growth that has consistantly outstripped our mechanisms
for directing the interest in the Kubernetes project and ecosystem towards productive activities. In particular
the burden of maintaining the project must scale sub linearly with the size of the user base if stewardship of
the project, and therefore the project itself, is expected to be sustainable. Today, as with [many other projects][],
project maintenance is unsustainable. It is currently infeasible, due to a combination of technical and human
bandwidth constraints, to:

- generate a forward looking road map of planned changes beyond the current release
- enforce "quality standards" by gating submitted changes
- automatically save the list of enhancements proposed for a release in a discoverable
  location for future analysis
- determine the provenance of an arbitrary Pull Request to `https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes` let alone other
  repositories which collectively determine the "bill of materials" required to provision a Kubernetes cluster

Worse still, several important concepts remain without definition in the project such as:

- enhancement sponsorship criteria
- graduation criteria (in this case meaning enhancement stability: alpha, beta, GA)

Additionally, there is no standardized place to organize discussion around:

- test plans
- information for operators
- information for developers
- user experience reports
- development status updates for major enhancements outside of Pull Requests

The [Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal][] (KEP) Process was created to begin to address our generalized problems with
planning at the scale of the Kubernetes project. While perhaps an improvement over the existing [design proposal][]
process, the KEP Process today suffers from the predictable consistency challenges when a process lacks tooling for
participants and validation of the correctness of content before acceptance. The [existing KEP content][] as well as
[incoming KEP content][] betrays the historical, and arguably continued, failure to organize cross functional delivery
teams at the beginning of whatever internal, generally corporate, process that occurs before a Pull Request describing
a technical proposal is created. The consistent failure to provide English language, apologies to our large and
international community, descriptions despite [well articulated][] arguments that such information _must_ precede
any fruitful technical discussion, or in fact that developing and encoding such explanations are the [primary activity][]
of software development itself. The development of tooling to support the KEP Process is currently being developed to help
address our current challenges with planning at scale.

## Objectives and Key Results

Hopefully an MVP quality sketch of how planning could work within the Kubernetes project will be completed within Q1 2019 with the
goal of improving the lives of folks comprising {The Release Team, SIG Architecture, SIG PM}.

#### For the Release Team

The KEP Process provides a useful gating mechanism for the Release Team.

- automatable criteria exists for introducing a KEP into the Release Process
- a well defined location exists for the association of GitHub Pull Requests to
  an existing KEP

#### For SIG Architecture

The KEP Process provides a useful gating mechanism for API Reviews.

- automatable criteria exists for requesting an API Review from SIG Architecture

#### For SIG PM

The KEP Process provides a useful mechanism for explaining major proposed changes to Kubernetes,
and collecting user feedback during implementation and stabilization.

- automatically store information about enhancements accepted for a release in a discoverable location
- standardized location for collecting user feedback in order to evaluate enhancement promotion requests
