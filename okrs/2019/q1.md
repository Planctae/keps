## Introduction

We have been blessed with amazing organic growth that has consistently outstripped our mechanisms
for fully directing the interest in the Kubernetes project towards productive ends. In particular,
the burden of maintaining the project must scale sub-linearly with `{favoriteGrowthMetric}` if stewardship of
the project, and therefore the project itself, is expected to be sustainable. Unfortunately, as with [other projects][],
the burden of project maintenance is approaching unsustainable levels. At the same time it is currently infeasible to:

- generate a forward looking road map of planned changes beyond the current release
- enforce "quality standards" by gating submitted changes
- automatically save the list of enhancements proposed for a release in a discoverable
  location for future analysis
- determine the provenance of an arbitrary Pull Request to `https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes` let alone other
  repositories which collectively determine the "bill of materials" required to provision a Kubernetes cluster

Worse still, several important concepts remain without definition in the project such as:

- enhancement sponsorship criteria
- graduation criteria (in this case meaning enhancement stability: alpha, beta, GA)

Additionally, there is no standardized place to organize discussion around:

- test plans
- information for operators
- information for developers
- user experience reports
- development status updates for major enhancements outside of Pull Requests

The [Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal][] (KEP) Process was created to begin to address our generalized problems with
planning at the scale of the Kubernetes project. While hopefully an improvement over the existing [design proposal][]
process, the KEP Process today suffers from predictable consistency challenges when a process lacks tooling for
participants and validation of the consistency of content before acceptance. The [existing KEP content][] as well as
[incoming KEP content][] betrays the challenge of leveraging cross functional delivery teams before a Pull Request describing
a technical proposal is even created. The constant struggle to produce high quality summaries for major changes limits the
broader understanding of the impact of the incredible work done within the community and wider ecosystem. As others have
made in [well articulated][] arguments, the importance of explaining the motivation behind a proposed change _must_
precede any fruitful technical discussion. A clear understanding of the motivation for a proposed change is the basis
of the extension of trust required to slowly [evolve the definition][] of what Kubernetes is. It is hoped
that an increase in the volume of prose, combined with automation will provide the guidance that will help project
maintainers maintain and improve the high quality standards our users demand.

The development of tooling to support the KEP Process is currently being developed to help address a small collection
of our current challenges with planning and execution at Kubernetes scale.

## Objectives and Key Results

Hopefully an MVP quality sketch of how planning could work within the Kubernetes project will be completed within Q1 2019 with the
goal of improving the lives of folks comprising {The Release Team, SIG Architecture, SIG PM}.

#### For the Release Team

The KEP Process provides a useful gating mechanism for the Release Team.

- automatable criteria exists for introducing a KEP into the Release Process
- a well defined location exists for the association of GitHub Pull Requests to
  an existing KEP

#### For SIG Architecture

The KEP Process provides a useful gating mechanism for API Reviews.

- automatable criteria exists for requesting an API Review from SIG Architecture

#### For SIG PM

The KEP Process provides a useful mechanism for explaining major proposed changes to Kubernetes,
and collecting user feedback during implementation and stabilization.

- automatically store information about enhancements accepted for a release in a discoverable location
- standardized location for collecting user feedback in order to evaluate enhancement promotion requests
