# KEPs Example CLI

This CLI exercises the `keps` library currently being developed
[by calebmiles@](https://github.com/calebamiles/keps). This example implementation
is meant to allow parallelize collection of feedback on the mechanics of
interacting with KEPs and the onboarding of additional maintainers who will implement
an official upstream CLI alongisde the existing library code.

KEPs are intended to be an interative process which, in the ideal case, transparently
persists the provenence of a major or otherwise important change to Kubernetes. KEPs
are intended to be a vehichle for managing Change at the Speed of Trust by allowing 
cross functional teams to manage the delivery of an enhancement throughout its
lifecycle.

This repository is also intented for experimentation on the connection of KEPs to
other change management (e.g API Review, Release Process) systems used in the
community.
