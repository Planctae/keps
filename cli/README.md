# KEPs Example CLI

KEPs are intended to be an interative process which, in the ideal case, transparently
persists the provenence of a major or otherwise important change to Kubernetes. KEPs
are intended to be a vehichle for managing Change at the Speed of Trust by allowing 
cross functional teams to manage the delivery of an enhancement throughout its
lifecycle.

This CLI is intended to be an example which exercises the [KEP library code][]. Other
implementations are certainly possible and notable examples from the community may be
listed here as they're developed.
